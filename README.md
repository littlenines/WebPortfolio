# Web Portfolio

My web portfolio where the wireframe was based on Denis Ivanovs portfolio with lots of changes and done in Nuxt.js ,Vuetify and Vue.js <br> 
I wanted to showcase my projects instead of just sending github links which i know would be bothersome for people. <br>
At the same time i learned how to use localStorage and change css root with Vue.js.
