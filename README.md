# Web Portfolio

My web portfolio where the wireframe was based on Denis Ivanovs portfolio with lots of changes and done in Nuxt.js ,Vuetify and Vue.js <br> 
I wanted to showcase my projects instead of just sending github links which i know would be bothersome for people. <br><br>
At the bottom right are controls for page navigation and email (upon clicking it the user must have a default mail client installed) <br>
At the same time i learned how to use localStorage and change css root with Vue.js.

## Deploy and Note 

This repository is not the deployed one , the reason being with few complications with heroku. For some reason i couldn't deploy this repository , the problem was most likely the usage of `Yarn` , the moment i switched to `npm` everything worked fine and for that reason i suggest choosing npm package when creating `nuxt-app`. <br><br>

#### Deploy on Heroku

1. Make a free account on Heroku 
2. Install [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
3. Add `"heroku-postbuild": "npm run build"` in `package.json`
``` javascript
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nuxt",
  "build": "nuxt build",
  "start": "nuxt start",
  "heroku-postbuild": "npm run build"
}
```
4. Create the Procfile <br>
<i>This special file specifies the commands that are executed by the app on startup.
Create a file and name it Procfile with no file extension, then inside it write:</i>
``` javascript
web: npm run start
```
5. Finally, we can build our app running into the terminal the command:
``` javascript
npm run build
```
<br>
6. <b>Initialize a local Git repository</b> <br> <br>

``` javascript
> git init

Initialized empty Git repository in .git/

> git add .
> git commit -m "My commit message"

Created initial commit 5df2d09: My commit message
 44 files changed, 8393 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 README
 create mode 100644 Procfile
...
```
7. Create a Heroku app <br>
<i> The heroku create CLI command creates a new empty application on Heroku, along with an associated empty Git repository. If you run this command from your appâ€™s root directory, the empty Heroku Git repository is automatically set as a remote for your local repository. </i> <br>

```
> heroku create your-random-app-name
```
> Now, we have to tell Heroku to install the devDependencies of our project (to be able to launch `npm run build`):

```
> heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false
```

> Also, we want our application to listen on the `host 0.0.0.0` and run in production mode:
```
> heroku config:set HOST=0.0.0.0
> heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production
```
8. Finally, we can push the app on Heroku with:
```
> git push heroku master
```
